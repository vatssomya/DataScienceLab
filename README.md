This repository contains a collection of experiments and practical exercises focused on key data science workflows, including data cleaning, visualization, and testing. The aim is to explore techniques and tools used to preprocess datasets, gain insights through visual analytics, and validate data-driven hypotheses or models. It serves both as a learning archive and a base for future data-driven projects.

## Key Areas Covered:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
Visualization: Exploring data through plots, charts, and interactive dashbards.
Testing: Performing statistical tests and validating assumptions in datasets.
